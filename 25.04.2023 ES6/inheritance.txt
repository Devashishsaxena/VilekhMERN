Inheritance (is-a relationship) : It is an object oreinted feature which
 signify sharing of properties & behaviour of one 
 class in another class is inheritance , used to implement modularity 
 at application level

ERP : College resources
Admin , Student , Accounts , Staff

Each module will be implemented as class & used to deploy code reusability 
& re-implementation

                       is-a
             Class A  <-----  Class B

class A : Base - Parent - Super class 
class B : Derived - Child - Sub class

syntax :

class Base
{
 data member
 member methods 
}

class Derived extends Base
{
 data member
 member methods 
}

Types of Inheritance :-

-> Single level inheritance
-> Multilevel level inheritance
-> Hierarchical inheritance
-> Multiple inheritance
-> Hybrid inheritance

Note : In case of multiple inheritance , multiple base class 
provides property to single derived class , in this case if 
multiple base contain data or functionality with same name is 
considered as ambiguity problem

class A
          <------- class C 
class B  

* Due to ambiguity problem , multiple inheritance is not supported
* To implement interface Typescript is used
