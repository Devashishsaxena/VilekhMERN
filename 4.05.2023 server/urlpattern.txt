url pattern :-

http://localhost:8081   /contact/p1/p2/...
        s1                      s2

?username=admin&password=admin123
            s3

s1 : Domain
s2 : url path (routing must be done using path)        
s3 : data attached with url (query string)

req.url = s2+s3

Routing must be done as per url path, to extract
url from path url must be parsed
