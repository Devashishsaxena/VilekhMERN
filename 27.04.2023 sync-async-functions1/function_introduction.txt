Synchronous or Blocking Functions & Asynchronous or Non-Blocking Functions :- 
It is function classification on the basis of its working style.

-> Synchronous or Blocking Functions : Functions are block of code which will be executed 
when it is called , function independent of time taken for execution will wait & once 
execution is completed next proccess will be executed. Considered as synchronous or 
Blocking function

-> Asynchronous or Non-Blocking Functions : Functions are block of code which will be executed
 when it is called , function which on execution will not intrupt further proccess from 
 execution is asynchronous or Non-blocking function

Note : -> By default all functions are synchronous in nature , only callback 
function is manually implemented asynchronous in nature

-> By default NodeJS is unithreaded in nature , by the implementation of 
Asynchronous function node becomes multithreaded
