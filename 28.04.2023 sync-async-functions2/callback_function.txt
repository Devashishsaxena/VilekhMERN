Callback Functions : Functions are block of code which will be executed when it is called , on execution function have capacity to return value.

Function executed in response of execution of another function is callback function

Note : 

-> By default callback function is sync in nature , by default max callback are implemented async as per requirement.

-> As max callback have asynchronous implementations , while when multiple callback are used it is possible that async responses may overlap each other & callback chaning is another problem with callback functions with leads to generate 'callback hell' problem.

-> To overcome callback hell 'Promise' is used
